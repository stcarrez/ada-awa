# Users Module
The `users` module manages the creation, update, removal and authentication
of users in an application.  The module provides the foundations for user
management in a web application.

A user can register himself by using a subscription form.  In that case,
a verification mail is sent and the user has to follow the verification
link defined in the mail to finish the registration process.  The user
will authenticate using a password.

A user can also use an OAuth/OpenID account and be automatically authentified
and registered to the application.  By using an external authentication
server, passwords are not stored in the application.

A user can have one or several permissions that allow to protect the
application data.  User permissions are managed by the `Permissions.Module`.

## Integration
The `User_Module` manages the creation, update, removal of users
in an application.  It provides operations that are used by the user
beans or other services to create and update wiki pages.
An instance of the `User_Module` must be declared and registered in the
AWA application.  The module instance can be defined as follows:

```Ada
type Application is new AWA.Applications.Application with record
   User_Module : aliased AWA.Users.Modules.User_Module;
end record;
```

And registered in the `Initialize_Modules` procedure by using:

```Ada
Register (App    => App.Self.all'Access,
          Name   => AWA.Users.Modules.NAME,
          Module => App.User_Module'Access);
```

## OAuth Authentication Flow
The OAuth/OpenID authentication flow is implemented by using two servlets
that participate in the authentication.  A first servlet will start
the OAuth/OpenID authentication by building the request that the user
must use to authenticate through the OAuth/OpenID authorization server.
This servlet is implemented by the `AWA.Users.Servlets.Request_Auth_Servlet`
type.  The servlet will respond to an HTTP `GET` request and it will
redirect the user to the authorization server.

The user will be authenticated by the OAuth/OpenID authorization server
and when s/he grants the application to access his or her account,
a redirection is made to the second servlet.  The second servlet
is implemented by `AWA.Users.Servlets.Verify_Auth_Servlet`.  It is used
to validate the authentication result by checking its validity with
the OAuth/OpenID authorization endpoint.  During this step, we can
retrieve some minimal information that uniquely identifies the user
such as a unique identifier that is specific to the OAuth/OpenID
authorization server.  It is also possible to retrieve the
user's name and email address.

These two servlets are provided by the `User_Module` and they are
registered under the `openid-auth` name for the first step and
under the `openid-verify` name for the second step.


## Configuration
The *users* module uses a set of configuration properties to configure
the OpenID integration.

## Ada Beans
Several bean types are provided to represent and manage the users.
The user module registers the bean constructors when it is initialized.
To use them, one must declare a bean definition in the application
XML configuration.


| Name           | Description                                                               |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|login|This bean is used by the login form|
|register|This bean is used by the registration form|
|resetPassword|This bean is used by the reset password form|
|lostPassword|This bean is used by the lost password form|
|logout|This bean is used by the logout process|
|user|This bean allows to provide information about the current logged user.|
