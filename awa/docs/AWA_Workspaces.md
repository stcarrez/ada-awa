# Workspaces Module
The *workspaces* plugin defines a workspace area for other plugins.
The workspace is intended to link together all the data objects that an application
manages for a given user or group of users.  A workspace is a possible mechanism
to provide and implement multi-tenancy in a web application.  By using the workspace plugin,
application data from different customers can be kept separate from each other in the
same database.

## Events
The *workspaces* module provides several events that are posted when some action are performed.

### invite-user

send the associated invitation email to the invitee.  The event contains the following
attributes:

key

inviter

### accept-invitation
This event is posted when an invitation is accepted by a user.
