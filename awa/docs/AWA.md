# AWA Core

## Initialization
The AWA application is represented by the `Application` type which should
be extended for the final application to provide the modules and specific
components of the final application.

The initialization of an AWA application is made in several steps
represented by different procedures of the main `Application` type.
The whole initialization is handled by the `Initialize` procedure
which gets a first set of configuration properties and a factory
to build specific component.

The `Initialize` procedure will perform the following steps:

* It uses the factory to allocate the ASF lifecycle handler, the navigation
 handler, the security manager, the OAuth manager, the exception
 handlers.

* It calls the `Initialize_Components` procedure to let the
 application register all the ASF components.  These components must
 be registered before any configuration file is read.

* It calls the `Initialize_Config`

* It calls the `Initialize_Servlets` procedure to allow the application
 to register all the servlet instances used by the application.

* It calls the `Initialize_Filters` procedure to allow the application
 to register all the servlet filter instances.  The application servlets
 and filters must be registered before reading the global configuration file.

* It loads the global application configuration by reading the `awa.xml`
 file.  By reading this configuration, some global configuration is
 established on the servlets, filters.

* It calls the `Initialize_Modules` procedure so that all the application
 modules can be registered, configured and initialized.  Each module
 brings its own component, servlet and filter.  They are configured
 by their own XML configuration file.

* It loads the module application configuration by reading the XML
 files described by the `app.config.plugins` configuration.  This last
 step allows the application to setup and update the configuration
 of all modules that have been registered.

## Configuration
The following global configuration parameter are defined:


| Name                      | Description                                                    |

## AWA Modules
A module is a software component that can be integrated in the
web application.  The module can bring a set of service APIs,
some Ada beans and some presentation files.  The AWA framework
allows to configure various parts of a module when it is integrated
in an application.  Some modules are designed to be re-used by
several applications (for example a _mail_ module, a _users_
module, ...).  Other modules could be specific to an application.
An application will be made of several modules, some will be
generic some others specific to the application.

### Registration
The module should have only one instance per application and it must
be registered when the application is initialized.  The module
instance should be added to the application record as follows:

```Ada
type Application is new AWA.Applications.Application with record
   Xxx       : aliased Xxx_Module;
end record;
```

The application record must override the `Initialize_Module` procedure
and it must register the module instance.  This is done as follows:

```Ada
overriding
procedure Initialize_Modules (App : in out Application) is
begin
   Register (App    => App.Self.all'Access,
             Name   => Xxx.Module.NAME,
             URI    => "xxx",
             Module => App.User_Module'Access);
end Initialize_Modules;
```

The module is registered under a unique name.  That name is used
to load the module configuration.

### Configuration
The module is configured by using an XML or a properties file.
The configuration file is used to define:

  * the Ada beans that the module defines and uses,

  * the events that the module wants to receive and the action
 that must be performed when the event is posted,

  * the permissions that the module needs and how to check them,

  * the navigation rules which are used for the module web interface,

  * the servlet and filter mappings used by the module

The module configuration is located in the *config* directory
and must be the name of the module followed by the file extension
(example: `module-name`.xml or `module-name`.properties).


## AWA Permissions
The *AWA.Permissions* framework defines and controls the permissions used by an application
to verify and grant access to the data and application service.  The framework provides a
set of services and API that helps an application in enforcing its specific permissions.
Permissions are verified by a permission controller which uses the service context to
have information about the user and other context.  The framework allows to use different
kinds of permission controllers.  The `Entity_Controller` is the default permission
controller which uses the database and an XML configuration to verify a permission.

### Declaration
To be used in the application, the first step is to declare the permission.
This is a static definition of the permission that will be used to ask to verify the
permission.  The permission is given a unique name that will be used in configuration files:

```Ada
with Security.Permissions;
...
package ACL_Create_Post is new Security.Permissions.Definition ("blog-create-post");
```

### Checking for a permission
A permission can be checked in Ada as well as in the presentation pages.
This is done by using the `Check` procedure and the permission definition.  This operation
acts as a barrier: it does not return anything but returns normally if the permission is
granted.  If the permission is denied, it raises the `NO_PERMISSION` exception.

Several `Check` operation exists.  Some require no argument and some others need a context
such as some entity identifier to perform the check.

```Ada
with AWA.Permissions;
...
AWA.Permissions.Check (Permission => ACL_Create_Post.Permission,
                       Entity     => Blog_Id);
```

### Configuring a permission
The *AWA.Permissions* framework supports a simple permission model
The application configuration file must provide some information to help in checking the
permission.  The permission name is referenced by the `name` XML entity.  The `entity-type`
refers to the database entity (ie, the table) that the permission concerns.
The `sql` XML entity represents the SQL statement that must be used to verify the permission.

```Ada
<entity-permission>
  <name>blog-create-post</name>
  <entity-type>blog</entity-type>
  <description>Permission to create a new post.</description>
  <sql>
    SELECT acl.id FROM acl
    WHERE acl.entity_type = :entity_type
    AND acl.user_id = :user_id
    AND acl.entity_id = :entity_id
  </sql>
</entity-permission>
```

### Adding a permission
Adding a permission means to create an `ACL` database record that links a given database
entity to the user.  This is done easily with the `Add_Permission` procedure:

```Ada
with AWA.Permissions.Services;
...
AWA.Permissions.Services.Add_Permission (Session => DB,
                                         User    => User,
                                         Entity  => Blog);
```

|remove-permission|Delete the permission associated with a user and an object|
|remove-entity-permission|Delete all the permission associated with an object|
|remove-user-permission|Delete all the permission associated with a user|


## AWA Events
The `AWA.Events` package defines an event framework for modules to post
events and have Ada bean methods be invoked when these events are dispatched.
Subscription to events is done through configuration files.  This allows to
configure the modules and integrate them together easily at configuration time.

### Declaration
Modules define the events that they can generate by instantiating the
`Definition` package. This is a static definition of the event.  Each event
is given a unique name.

```Ada
with AWA.Events.Definition;
...
package Event_New_User is new AWA.Events.Definition ("new-user");
```

### Posting an event
The module can post an event to inform other modules or the system that
a particular action occurred.  The module creates the event instance of
type `Module_Event` and populates that event with useful properties for
event receivers.

```Ada
with AWA.Events;
...
Event : AWA.Events.Module_Event;
Event.Set_Event_Kind (Event_New_User.Kind);
Event.Set_Parameter ("email", "harry.potter@hogwarts.org");

```

The module will post the event by using the <b>Send_Event</b> operation.

```Ada
Manager.Send_Event (Event);
```

### Receiving an event
Modules or applications interested by a particular event will configure
the event manager to dispatch the event to an Ada bean event action.
The Ada bean is an object that must implement a procedure that matches
the prototype:

```Ada
type Action_Bean is new Util.Beans.Basic.Readonly_Bean ...;
procedure Action (Bean : in out Action_Bean;
                  Event : in AWA.Events.Module_Event'Class);
```

The Ada bean method and object are registered as other Ada beans.

The configuration file indicates how to bind the Ada bean action and
the event together.  The action is specified using an EL Method Expression
(See [Ada EL](https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-el) or JSR 245).

```Ada
<on-event name="new_user">
    <action>#{ada_bean.action}</action>
</on-event>
```

### Event queues and dispatchers
The `AWA.Events` framework posts events on queues and it uses a dispatcher
to process them.  There are two kinds of dispatchers:

  * Synchronous dispatcher process the event when it is posted.
 The task which posts the event invokes the Ada bean action.
 In this dispatching mode, there is no event queue.
 If the action method raises an exception, it will however be blocked.

  * Asynchronous dispatcher are executed by dedicated tasks.  The event
 is put in an event queue.  A dispatcher task processes the event and
 invokes the action method at a later time.

When the event is queued, there are two types of event queues:

  * A Fifo memory queue manages the event and dispatches them in FIFO order.
 If the application is stopped, the events present in the Fifo queue
 are lost.

  * A persistent event queue manages the event in a similar way as the
 FIFO queue but saves them in the database.  If the application is
 stopped, events that have not yet been processed will be dispatched
 when the application is started again.

### Data Model
![](images/awa_events_model.png)

## AWA Commands
The `AWA.Commands` package provides a simple framework with commands that
allow to start, stop, configure and manage the web application.  It is also
possible to provide your own commands.  The command framework handles the
parsing of command line options, identification of the command to execute
and execution of the selected command.

### Command Usage

#### SYNOPSIS

_driver_ [-v] [-vv] [-vvv] [-c _config-file_ ] _command_
 [-k _file_ ] [ -d
_dir_ ] [ -p _password_ ] [--password _password_ ] [--passfile
_file_ ] [--passenv _name_ ] [--passfd
_fd_ ] [--passask] [--passcmd
_cmd_ ] [--wallet-key-file
_file_ ]

#### DESCRIPTION

The `AWA.Commands.Drivers` framework integrates the Ada Keystore support
to access some sensitive configuration information such as passwords,
database connection strings, API secret keys.  The use of the Ada Keystore
storage is optional.  It is enabled when the `-k _file_` option is
specified.  When such secure storage is used, a primary password to
unlock the keystore is necessary.  Passwords are retrieved using one
of the following options:

* by reading a file that contains the password,

* by looking at an environment variable,

* by using a command line argument,

* by getting the password through the _ssh-askpass_(1) external command,

* by running an external command,

* by using a GPG private key,

* by asking interactively the user for the password,

* by asking through a network socket for the password.

When the Ada Keystore is used, it is global to all the applications that
are registered in the Web server container.  To allow to differentiate
application specific configuration, each configuration parameter is
prefixed by the application name.

To create and update the keystore file, it is necessary to use the
_akt_(1) tool.  The tool provides many commands for the creation,
insertion, removal and update of content that is stored in the keystore file.

If the keystore file was locked by using GPG, it is not necessary to
specify any specific option to unlock the keystore.  All is needed is the
availability of the _gpg2_(1) command with the private key to unlock the keystore.

The server global configuration file that is read with the `-c config-file` option
can contain the following configuration:

| Name                      | Description                                                      |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|keystore-path              | The path to the global keystore file                             |
|keystore-masterkey-path    | The path of the file that contains the master keys               |
|keystore-password-path     | The path of the file that contains the keystore password         |
|gpg-encrypt                | When GPG is used, the GPG command to encrypt some content        |
|gpg-decrypt                | When GPG is used, the GPG command to decrypt some content        |
|gpg-list-keys              | When GPG is used, the GPG command to list the available GPG keys |

#### OPTIONS

The following options are recognized by the command driver:

-V

Prints the
application version.

-v

Enable the verbose mode.

-vv

Enable debugging output.

-vvv

Enable debugging output.

-c _config-file_

Defines the path of the global
server configuration file.

-k file

Specifies the path of the keystore file to open.

-p password

The keystore password is passed within the command line.
Using this method is convenient but is not safe.

--passenv envname

The keystore password is passed within an environment variable with the
given name.  Using this method is considered safer but still provides
some security leaks.

--passfile path

The keystore password is passed within a file that is read.
The file must not be readable or writable by other users or group:
its mode must be r??------.  The directory that contains the file
must also satisfy the not readable by other users or group members,
This method is safer.

--passfd fd

The keystore password is passed within a pipe whose file descriptor
number is given.  The file descriptor is read to obtain the password.
This method is safer.

--passask

The keystore password is retrieved by the running the external tool
_ssh-askpass_(1) which will ask the password through either KDE, Gnome or another
desktop interactive application.
The password is retrieved through a pipe that
the driver sets while launching the command.

--passcmd cmd

The keystore password is retrieved by the running the external command defined in
_cmd_. The command should print the password on its standard output without end of line.
The password is retrieved through a pipe that
the driver sets while launching the command.

--wallet-key-file file

Defines the path of a file which contains the wallet master key file.


#### COMMANDS


##### The start command


_driver_ start [--management-port _PORT_] [--port _PORT_] [--connection _COUNT_]
[--upload _DIR_] [--tcp-no-delay] [--daemon] [--keystore _PATH_]

The `start` command allows to start the server and all applications that are
registered to the web container.  When a keystore is specified, it is first
unlocked by using one of the unlock mechanism (password, GPG, ...).
Then, each application is configured by using its own configuration file
and a subset of the keystore secured configuration.
Once each application is configured, the web server container is started
to listen to the TCP/IP port defined by the `--port=`_PORT_ option.
Applications are then started and they can serve HTTP requests through
the web server container.

At the same time, a management port is created and used exclusively by
the `stop` command to stop the web server container.  The `start` command
will wait on that management port for the `stop` command to be executed.
The management port is configured by the `--management=`_PORT_ option.
The management port is local to the host and cannot be accessed remotely.

When the `--daemon` option is used, the server will first put itself in
the background.  This option is supported only under some Unix systems
like _GNU/Linux_ and _FreeBSD_ and more generally every system where
the `daemon(3)` C-library call is supported.  On other systems, this option
has no effect.

The `--tcp-no-delay` option is supported for recent version of
Ada Web Server and configure the web server to use the `TCP_NO_DELAY`
option of the TCP/IP stack (strongly recommended).

The `--upload=`_DIR_ option indicates to the web server container
the directory that can be used to store temporarily the uploaded files
that the server receives.

The `--connection=`_COUNT_ option controls the maximum number of active
HTTP requests that the server can handle.

##### The setup command

_driver_ setup [--management-port _PORT_] [--port _PORT_] [--connection _COUNT_]
[--upload _DIR_] [--tcp-no-delay] [--daemon] [--keystore _PATH_] _NAME_

The `setup` command is very close to the `start` command but it starts
the [Setup Application](AWA_Setup.md) to configure the application by
using a web browser.


##### The stop command

_driver_ stop [--management-port _PORT_] [--keystore _PATH_]

The `stop` command is used to inform a running web server container to stop.
The management port is used to connect to the web server container and stop it.
The management port is local to the host and cannot be accessed remotely.

The management port is configured with the `--management-port=`_PORT_ option.

##### The list command

_driver_ list [--application _NAME_] [--keystore _PATH_]
[--users] [--jobs] [--sessions] [--tables]

The `list` command is intended to help in looking at the application
database and see some important information.  Because the database is
specific to each application, it may be necessary to indicate the
application name by using the `--application=`_NAME_ option.

The `--tables` option triggers the list of database tables with the
number of entries they contain.

The `--users` option triggers the list of users that are registered in
the application.

The `--sessions` option triggers the list of user connection sessions.

The `--jobs` option triggers the list of jobs that have been created
and scheduled.

##### The info command

_driver_ info [--application _NAME_] [--keystore _PATH_] [--long-lines]

The `info` command reports the current configuration used by the
application.  The configuration is extracted from the AWA default
XML configuration files and can be overriden by the application
specific configuration.  The command allows to see what is the
actual configuration.  The configuration is printed with the
configuration name and its associated value.

The list of configuration parameters are grouped in several categories:

* `Database configuration` gives the configuration properties for the
 database configuration.

* `Server faces configuration` lists the configuration use by the
 Ada Servlets and [Ada Server Faces](https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-asf).

* `AWA Application` lists the core AWA configuration properties.

Depending on whether a module is used by the application, a number
of modules are listed with their configuration.

The `--long-lines` option triggers the list of database tables with the
number of entries they contain.


### Integration
The `AWA.Commands` framework is split in several generic packages that
must be instantiated.  The `AWA.Commands.Drivers` generic package is
the primary package that must be instantiated.  It provides the core
command line driver framework on top of which the commands are implemented.
The instantiation needs two parameter: the name of the application and
the type of the web server container.  When using Ada Web Server, the
following instantiation example can be used:

```Ada
with Servlet.Server.Web;
with AWA.Commands.Drivers;
...
package Server_Commands is
   new AWA.Commands.Drivers
      (Driver_Name    => "atlas",
       Container_Type => Servlet.Server.Web.AWS_Container);
```

The `Driver_Name` is used to print the name of the command when
some usage or help is printed.  The `Container_Type` is used to
declare the web container onto which applications are registered
and which provides the web server core implementation.  The web
server container instance is available through the `WS` variable
defined in the `Server_Commands` package.

Once the command driver is instantiated, it is necessary to instantiate
each command that you wish to integrate in the final application.
For example, to integrate the `start` command, you will do:

```Ada
with AWA.Commands.Start;
...
package Start_Command is new AWA.Commands.Start (Server_Commands);
```

To integrate the `stop` command, you will do:

```Ada
with AWA.Commands.Stop;
...
package Stop_Command is new AWA.Commands.Stop (Server_Commands);
```

The instantiation of one of the command, automatically registers the
command to the command driver.
